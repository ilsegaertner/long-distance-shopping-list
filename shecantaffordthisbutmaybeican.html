      letter of a young poet
      <p>
        Disasters, scarcity, pain and hunger, however
        <br />
        we breath and bath to not go under, the
        <br />
        kids worldwide erupt their lust, in
        <br />
        acts of adolescent dust.
        <br />
        When winds are wise and bright and clear,
        <br />
        Forgotten energies appear,
        <br />
        A queen as firm and sweet alike,
        <br />
        completes a third path of her life.
        <br />
        <br />
        And thanks to her, the poet dwells,
        <br />
        in love 'n memories despite farewells,
        <br />
        The poet juxtaposes money,
        <br />
        For loving her! her!! her!!!
        <br />
        his honey.
        <br />
        <br />... (K.F., unfinished poem)
